# React-Redux Template

## What is it

This template was created after completion of a larger project. I took almost everything not related to the implementation of redux and removed it leaving only the files in which redux was required and adding comments for myself. The goal is to not have to spend hours searching through old projects trying to remember syntax and data flow to get redux working in an existing project/ current project.

## How to use

The intention is that you can go file by file through the template and copy the syntax to place redux into any project. There is very little left in the files that is not directly related to redux implementation so my hope is that it is easy to use. This is not a template to work off of as it is missing just about everything needed to make react work.
